"""The deterministic triage service: pure decision, redact-before-audit, soft escalation.

The consequential decision (the severity band and whether to escalate) is pure stdlib and
replayable; an LLM would only narrate, never produce the band. PII is redacted BEFORE anything
is written to the audit sink (R2/P-04), every result carries a citation, and a consequential
result escalates softly to a human (P-06) rather than auto-executing.

Rule R1: the guardrail screens BOTH directions of the one generation call this service makes,
the narrated ``summary`` (a fork that replaces the deterministic string below with a real model
call inherits this screening unchanged, because it wraps the STEP, not the string). INPUT: every
caller-supplied field, the case subject as well as its text, is screened before it is scored or
narrated at all, because the subject reaches the summary, the citation and the audit record
exactly as the text does. OUTPUT: the narrated summary is screened before it is audited or
returned. The text each screen hands back is the text used from then on, exactly as given.

A blocked direction is audited ``Decision.BLOCKED`` and raises
:class:`~.errors.GuardrailBlockedError`, never a partial result. A guardrail that cannot decide
(its backend errored or timed out) fails CLOSED the same way: the refusal is audited BLOCKED
when the audit sink can take it, and the guardrail's own error then reaches the caller.
