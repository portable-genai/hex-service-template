/**
 * A stack of stages where only the one in focus is open.
 *
 * The problem it solves: a console that shows its evidence honestly gets tall. Show the
 * inputs, then the arithmetic over them, then the generated artifact, and by the time the
 * artifact arrives the thing a reader came for is a screen and a half down. Embedded in
 * `journey-portal` it is worse, because the host gives each app an iframe shorter than a
 * full page.
 *
 * The move is to collapse what is ABOVE rather than scroll to what is below. Both put the
 * active stage in view; only one of them is stable. `scrollIntoView` on a page that is still
 * growing lands wherever the layout happened to be at the moment it fired, and it takes the
 * scroll position away from the reader, who then cannot tell whether they moved or the page
 * did. Collapsing above keeps the page pinned at the top and lets the active stage rise into
 * view on its own.
 *
 * Three rules the implementation exists to hold, each of which is a way this pattern is
 * usually got wrong:
 *
 * **A collapsed stage keeps its numbers.** The summary line carries the figures, so a stage
 * that closes still asserts what it found. Collapsing to a bare title deletes the evidence
 * the panel was added to show, which is worse than not collapsing at all. The strongest
 * form of that failure is the one this component replaced in `cio-advisory`: the evidence
 * panel was UNMOUNTED when the artifact arrived, so it did not just close, it left.
 *
 * **The reader outranks the state machine.** Once someone opens or closes a stage by hand,
 * that stage stops being driven automatically for the rest of the session. A panel that
 * reopens or slams shut under a reader who just touched it reads as broken.
 *
 * **Print shows everything.** A collapsed artifact that prints collapsed is a broken
 * deliverable, so `onbeforeprint` opens every stage.
 *
 * The provenance banner is deliberately NOT part of this: it lives in `app/layout.tsx`
 * outside `children`, so nothing here can collapse, push, or hide it. Keep it there. That
 * placement is structural rather than a convention, because a provenance strip that
 * scrolled off screen is a defect this fleet has already shipped once, in eight consoles,
 * and an auto-collapse over the banner would reintroduce it wholesale.
 *
 * Usage: give each stage a `ready` flag, ask `activeStage` which one is in focus, and pass
 * the `useStageTakeover` set to every stage. Put FIGURES in each `summary`, never just a
 * title.
 *
 * Native `<details>`/`<summary>` carries the keyboard and screen-reader behaviour, and the
 * open state survives with no JavaScript at all.
